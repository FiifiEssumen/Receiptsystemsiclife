I've created a comprehensive Django insurance policy receipt system with all the features for sales for an  LIFE Insurance Policy for students that automatically send a receipt to the client holder when consideration(payment) is made  


Here's what the system includes:
Key Features:

1. Student Model with Required Fields:
tudent Name, DOB, Program, Email, Parents Name, Parents Contact
UUID-based IDs for security
Program choices with predefined options

2. Payment Model with Auto-Invoice Generation:

Links to Student model
Multiple payment types (tuition, registration, exam, etc.)
Auto-generates invoice numbers
Automatically creates and sends PDF invoices when payment status changes to "completed"

3. PDF Invoice Generation:

Professional-looking invoices using ReportLab library
Includes all student and payment details
Formatted with tables and proper styling
Unique invoice numbers with date stamps

4. Email Automation:

Automatically sends PDF invoices to student's email when payment is completed
Customizable email templates
Tracks whether invoices have been sent
Admin action to resend invoices

5. Admin Interface:

Full admin interface for managing students and payments
Filtering and searching capabilities
Bulk actions for resending invoices

6. Web Views:

Student management views
Payment processing interface
Payment detail views
Manual invoice resending functionality

Setup Instructions:

Install Dependencies:

bashpip install Django>=4.2.0 reportlab>=4.0.0 Pillow>=10.0.0

Configure Email Settings: Update your settings.py with email configuration (examples provided in the code)
Run Migrations:

bashpython manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate

Create Superuser:

bashpython manage.py createsuperuser
How It Works:

Student Registration: Create student records with all required information
Payment Processing: When a payment is made and marked as "completed", the system automatically:

Generates a unique invoice number
Creates a professional PDF invoice
Sends the invoice to the student's email address
Marks the invoice as sent


Invoice Management: Admins can resend invoices, view payment history, and manage all records through the Django admin interface

The system is production-ready and includes proper error handling, security features (UUID-based IDs), and a clean admin interface for easy management.RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.
